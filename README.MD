# Technology Used (Libraries):
1. Valkyrie Emulator â€“ Custom technology created to port PS1 games easily to PC.
2. SDL2

# Supported Platforms:
Windows 7-11, Linux, Mac (64-bit), UWP, Xbox One/Series X(UWP), Web (Emscripten), Android. There are plans to support more platforms than what is currently listed.

# Project Scope:
We want to achieve the same functionality as the PlayStation version of Soul Reaver by decompiling the code and making a modern port of the game as the original source was lost. This is achieved by translating MIPS r3000a ASM to C. 

In addition, there should be a video settings menu where different rendering APIs can be selected (D3D9, D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, Vulkan etc.) intoduced at a later point.
Main advantages from the original pc port are: the restoration of the dynamic music system, potential for adding new levels, touchscreen support, multiplatform, full controller support, achievements, etc.

There may be plans to bring an "Definitive Edition" of Soul Reaver. This will be by including certain enhancements such as removing the software renderer in the future and include a full hardware rendered version of the game.
